                    Clyde (クライド Kuraido), also known as Guzuta, is one of the four main ghosts in the Pac-Man series.
                    While the other three ghosts are off chasing Pac-Man, Clyde will be off doing his own thing. He is
                    typically portrayed as the least intelligent and most submissive ghost. He is good friends with
                    Blinky, Pinky, and Inky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While originally one of the main antagonists in the first Pac-Man arcade game, his role has largely
                    been diminished to being a secondary antagonist or an ally in recent incarnations.

                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clyde is an orange-colored ghost. He has a somewhat dopey-looking expression. He is typically
                        limbless within games, but some incarnations show him with arms, sometimes with red gloves as
                        well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the TV series and Pac-Land, Clyde appears similar to a 1920's mob boss with a bowler derby
                        hat.
                        In Pac-Man Party and Ghostly Adventures, Clyde is very large, and has a curl of hair on his
                        head.
                        His appendages were made more tentacle-like as well.

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clyde in the early games tended to be very cowardly. His personality is probably best described
                        by
                        his alternate Japanese "Character" name, Crybaby. He doesn't mess with Pac-Man much, and is
                        sometimes shown to be afraid of him; he prefers to keep his distance as much as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures Clyde is shown to be more passive than the other ghosts
                        and
                        will sometimes try to break up fights between Blinky and Inky but he is also not shown to be
                        very
                        bright. But not completely stupid. He also loves animals. He is also one of only two ghosts who
                        is
                        good pretty much all year around according to Santa-Pac.
