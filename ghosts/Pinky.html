                    Pinky (ピンキー Pinkii) is one of the four main ghosts in the Pac-Man series. She represents as the only
                    female ghost and likes to be pretty. She attempts to ambush Pac-Man by moving parallel to him. In
                    certain continuities, Pinky has been shown to have a crush on Pac-Man, which normally goes
                    unreciprocated. She is good friends with Blinky, Inky, and Clyde.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While originally one of the main antagonists in the first Pac-Man arcade game, her role has largely
                    been diminished to being a secondary antagonist or an ally in recent incarnations.

                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pinky is a pink-colored ghost. She has big eyes, but her slanted eyelids and eyelashes partially
                        obscure them. She is typically limbless within games, but some incarnations show her with arms,
                        sometimes with gloves as well (either orange or purple-colored). She is sometimes seen wearing
                        makeup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the TV series and Pac-Land, Pinky wears a hat, and has a "tough guy" personality. In Pac-Man
                        Party and Ghostly Adventures, she has shoulder-length hair and blue eyes, and looks somewhat
                        younger; her arms are also stubbier
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, Pinky is a magenta-colored ghost.

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pinky is quite feminine and calm, but is just as mischievous as the rest of the Ghost Gang, and
                        won't hesitate to stop Pac-Man if he tries to stop their antics. When chasing Pac-Man/Ms.
                        Pac-Man in
                        the maze, her strategy is to ambush them rather than chase them. Even though she is not as fast
                        as
                        Blinky, this strategy makes her one of the more persistent and tricky ghosts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Pac N' Roll, she is shown to be quite cunning and mean, having been the one who came up with
                        the
                        plan to summon Golvis and ruin the Power Pellet Harvest Festival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, Pinky is shown to have a crush on Pac-Man. As with the
                        other
                        members of the original Ghost Gang, she is now an ally and friend of Pac-Man rather than an
                        enemy.

                    <h3>Gender</h3>
                    <P>
                        In Pinky's earliest American appearances, the character was often shown as being male, most
                        prominently in the 1982 animated series. The only American 80s media showing Pinky as female
                        were
                        the Pac-Man Trading Cards, of all things.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Seemingly starting in the late 80s, Pinky began appearing more feminine within promotional
                        artwork.
                        Both male and female designs for the character were used inconsistently throughout the 90s; by
                        the
                        2000s all games showed Pinky as a woman. The general consensus overall is that the character is
                        female.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Japan, on the other hand, Pinky has almost always been portrayed as female. Her first
                        appearance
                        depicting her female was on the flyers for the 1982 game, Super Pac-Man. The only game where she
                        was
                        depicted as male was Pac-Land, which used the same sprites for the ghosts regardless of country.
