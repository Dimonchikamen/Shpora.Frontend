                    Inky (インキー Inki), also known as Aosuke, is one of the four main ghosts in the Pac-Man series. He is
                    often depicted as a goofy and slow-headed ghost, not pursuing Pac-Man unless other ghosts are near.
                    He is good friends with Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While originally one of the main antagonists in the first Pac-Man arcade game, his role has changed
                    to being just a secondary antagonist or even an ally in recent iterations.

                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inky is a cyan (blue) colored ghost. He has big eyes, and often has a happy/excited expression.
                        He
                        is typically limbless within games, but some incarnations show him with arms, sometimes with
                        gloves
                        as well (either orange or teal-colored).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the TV series Inky wears a hat, and in Pac-Land he has a spot of hair. Both of these portrays
                        show Inky as being stupid (a role more commonly filled by Clyde). In Pac-Man Party and Ghostly
                        Adventures, Inky has little to no resemblance to his original design; he is very skinny, has
                        twirly
                        hair, and teeth. He is also a darker shade of blue, and is portrayed as being the smartest of
                        the
                        four ghosts.

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inky's personality is pretty straightforward; He's goofy, and usually doesn't fully think things
                        through. This often makes him appear a bit dimwitted, but not as much as Clyde. Inky is
                        typically
                        the funny and mellow ghost who tries to remain cool - but he fails to keep his cool when scared
                        or
                        scolded by his fellow ghosts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures Inky is mischievous and immature as well as goofy. He
                        often
                        quarrels with Pinky and Blinky.
