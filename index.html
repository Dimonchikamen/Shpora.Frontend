                <h2>Ghosts</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ghosts (also known as Monsters or Ghost Monsters) are the main enemies of the Pac-Man series and
                    have antagonized Pac-Man and all of Pac-Land in their appearances. The most notable ghosts are the
                    four
                    members of the Ghost Gang - Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde - who have appeared throughout the series
                    as
                    both antagonists and protagonists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite ghosts often being cruel and mischievous, some have been shown to be nice, but most have
                    rejoiced in antagonizing Pac-Man. They have to be careful though, because Pac-Man has a chance of
                    swallowing them whole, usually when a Power Pellet is obtained. They are spectral beings that dwell
                    in
                    Ghost Land and will sometimes travel to Pac-Land to cause havoc and mischief.

                <h2>Biology</h2>
                <p>
                    In the original games and cartoon, the Ghosts were originally portrayed as monsters that wore cloaks
                    and
                    are considered being tangible, as well as having feet that can only be seen visibly under their
                    cloak.
                    However, they had a few ghostly traits such as being able to levitate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the newer games and animated series, the Ghosts are portrayed as spectral ectoplasmic entities
                    with
                    the common ghostly traits of being semi-intangible, being able to levitate and can leave trails of
                    ectoplasm on living beings. They also do not appear to have a very good diet, with much of their
                    "food"
                    appearing to be made up mostly of inedible and gross muck like garbage, worms, body parts and other
                    unidentifiable substances and slimy goo, however, due to being spiritual entities without organs,
                    these
                    substances do no permanent harm to them. The fact that they have things such as sewers and sewage
                    implies they still need to expel bodily waste products like Pac-People. Blinky has even admitted to
                    passing gas on one occasion, which, sad to say, dramatically improved the smell of their food. With
                    proper seasoning, their food can be made edible to Pac-People.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It appears that the majority of ghosts are former Pac-People, but usually bare no resemblance to
                    their
                    living selves, and apparently they come in a wide variety of colors and types apart from the usual
                    standard ghostly appearance, with some appearing gigantic, cycloptic, octopus-like or etc, and it
                    appears that they may be able to freely change between these forms depending on their moods and
                    personalities, a likely benefit of no longer being restricted by physical forms. However, ghostly
                    animals appear to still somewhat resemble their living animal forms unlike Ghostly Pac-People.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They mainly attack Pac-People by biting them despite many having no visible teeth, covering them in
                    slime or eating them alive (according to the Atari 2600 manual of Pac-Man).
                </p>
                <h3>Weakness</h3>
                <p>
                    In the original games and cartoon, their main weakness is the Power Pellet, which can be eaten by
                    almost
                    any type of Pac-Being, such as Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Jr. Pac-Man, other Pac-People and Pac-Animals.
                    When
                    eaten, Pac-People posses the ability to eat them and it causes them to turn blue with fear. Once
                    eaten,
                    their empty bodies will return to a chamber in the center of a maze where Pac-Man has no access and
                    return to their original forms to continue chasing him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the newer games and animated series, Pac-Man is the only one capable of eating them due to his
                    status
                    as a "Yellow One" and can do so even without berries in certain games while in others it is
                    required.
                    Power Pellets have also been replaced with Power Berries which simply act as empowering items that
                    can
                    give Pac-Man unique abilities that can defeat Ghosts more easily, but are still not required for
                    eating
                    Ghosts.

                <h2>Ghost Gang</h2>
                <p>The Ghost Gang refers to the original antagonists of the first Pac-Man game, who return in most of
                    the
                    other games in the Pac-Man series. The group is comprised of four ghosts named Blinky, Pinky, Inky,
                    and
                    Clyde. In some appearances, they are joined by a fifth member named Sue, who originated from Ms.
                    Pac-Man
                    in place of Clyde.</p>
                <p>Their roles in the series have mostly varied; they were originally portrayed as villainous, but are
                    friendly in some later appearances. However, most of their solo villainous efforts usually consist
                    of
                    them just teasing or chasing Pac-Man (and family), while in others they take on a more antagonistic
                    role
                    due to being ordered to do so by their superiors (e.g. Spooky or the Ghost Witch). Nonetheless, it
                    appears they usually antagonize others simply for the fun and joy of scaring and pranking them,
                    rather
                    than genuine hate or malicious intent.</p>
                <p>Throughout the series, the roles and names of Blinky and Clyde are often mixed up; this has been
                    commonly
                    referred to by fans as the Clyde and Blinky error.</p>
